\section{Question No. 7}

I would then like to compare how these political parties were running their election campaign and what promises they made to how they actually allocated the budget once in power.\\

As for the answers are concerned:\\
\textbf{Q5:} The dataframe named "mydf" was of the type "tbl\_df", "tbl", "data.frame"; and "mydf\$date" was of the type "character"\\
\textbf{Q6:} The dataframe named "df1" was of the type "tbl\_df", "tbl", "data.frame"; and "df" was of the type "tbl\_spark", "tbl\_sql", "tbl\_lazy", "tbl".
